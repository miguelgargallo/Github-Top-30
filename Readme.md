# GitHub Top 30 Project Finder

## Overview of the project

Welcome to the GitHub Top 30 Project Finder! This project provides a tool for finding the top 30 most starred projects on GitHub.

## Purpose of the tool

The purpose of the tool is to provide developers with a way to easily find the most popular projects on GitHub. It uses the GitHub API to send a request for the top 30 most starred projects, and then parses the JSON data from the response to create a list of the top 30 projects. The results are written to a file called top30.md.

## Description of how the tool finds the top 30 most starred projects

The tool uses the requests module to send a GET request to the GitHub API. The API endpoint used in the request is:

```

```

The requests.get function sends the request and stores the response in a variable. The response.json function is used to parse the JSON data from the response.

## Explanation of how the results are written to a file

The results are written to a file called top30.md in Markdown format using the f string format. The file is opened for writing using the with open('top30.md', 'w') as f: syntax. The f string format is used to write the results to the file. The results are written in the following format:
